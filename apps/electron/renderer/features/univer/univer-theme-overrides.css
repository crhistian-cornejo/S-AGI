/**
 * Univer Theme Overrides
 *
 * Theming is done via the Univer theme object (univer-theme.ts) passed to
 * the constructor. ThemeService injects --univer-gray-*, --univer-white,
 * --univer-black, etc. from that object.
 *
 * We do NOT override those here. Overriding with design tokens (e.g. gray-800
 * = foreground/0.9) broke dark mode: Univer uses gray-800 for dark backgrounds
 * and gray-200 for text. Our mappings reversed that.
 *
 * globals.css still applies app-level overrides (--univer-bg-color,
 * .univer-toolbar, etc.) for layout/popovers. This file stays minimal.

/* No variable overrides – theme object drives Univer colors. */
